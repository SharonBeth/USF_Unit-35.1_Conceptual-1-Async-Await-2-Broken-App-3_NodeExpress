      urls.js  => For the node.js file to be ran to fs.read & fs.write to practice these commands.
      urls.txt => txt file of URL's, each on a new line. Some are intentionally incorrect to practice errors in the file. Also, the URL's are intentionally on a new line to work on commands for a new line to be incorporated into the code.
